IOOF Recruitment Robot Challenge

This is my Java Code for the IOOF Junior Developer Robot Challenge
It has three files. mainDriver.Java, Robot.Java,
RobotDriver.Java.

Also it has the sampleinput.txt. This is a input file and in the 
mainDriver.java the file reader points to the src/sampleinput.txt as the file path.
Sampleinput.txt is where the commands are issued and the path for the 
filereader in the maindriver.java will normally work if the project is opened 
in eclipse. Otherwise if opening using javac compiler the path should just be
"sampleinput.txt" and then it can be compiled.

This project will be on github as well as being sent via email
as a eclipse zip file.  The IoofExercise when downloaded from github or cloned, can be imported into eclipse as a file system.
